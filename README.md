# Bust-the-Ghost-A-Probabilistic-Reasoning-Game

This repository contains the implementation of the “Bust the Ghost” game, an interactive project combining gaming mechanics with Bayesian probabilistic inference. The game challenges players to locate a hidden ghost on a grid using probabilistic reasoning derived from sensor feedback.

Features

	•	An 8x13 interactive grid-based game.
	•	Dynamic probabilistic inference using Bayesian updates.
	•	Sensor feedback with color-coded proximity and directional hints.
	•	User-friendly interface with real-time probability visualization.
	•	Implementation of distance and directional sensors for enhanced gameplay.

Project Structure

	•	index.html: Game interface.
	•	styles.css: Styling for the game grid and GUI.
	•	game.js: Core game logic, including Bayesian inference and sensor integration.
	•	report.pdf: Detailed documentation of the project implementation and results.
	•	README.md: Project documentation.

 Gameplay Mechanics

	•	Start with 20 points and 2 bust attempts.
	•	Each action deducts points. Bust the ghost correctly to win or lose if points/busts run out.
	•	Use the “Bust the Ghost” button to make final guesses.
	•	Utilize sensor feedback and probability visualization to strategize effectively.

Results

	•	The game demonstrates practical applications of Bayesian inference in managing uncertainty.
	•	Engaging gameplay enhances understanding of probabilistic reasoning.
